Output:
The output must be formatted as JSON text. For example the following are valid outputs:
- {"name" : "request_payload","quality": "GOOD", "explanation" : "", "alternative" : ""}
- {"name" : "wc", "quality": "BAD", "explanation" : "The variable name is too short", "alternative" : "word_count"}
- {"name" : "s","quality": "BAD", "explanation" : "Very short names are reserved to indexes", "alternative" : "size"}

Context:
Quality can only be one of the following:
- GOOD
- NEUTRAL
- BAD

Consider the following C++ code when deciding the quality of a variable name:
<code>

Additionally consider those rules:
- Variable names should be explicit
- Variable names should be coherent with their usage
- Single letter variables names are forbidden, except if they represent counters.

Input:
Does the variable <variable> follow the rules?
Is <variable> a good name within the context of the provided code?
If the quality is BAD or NEUTRAL, always propose an alternative name.
