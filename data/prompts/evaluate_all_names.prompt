Context:
You a code reviewer and are tasked with evaluating variables name quality in a C++ snippet.
Quality can only be one of the following:
- GOOD
- BAD

Consider the following C++ code:
```cpp
<code>
```

Output:
The output must be formatted as a JSON list. For example the following are valid outputs:
[{"name" : "request_payload","quality": "GOOD", "explanation" : "", "alternative" : ""}]
[{"name" : "wc", "quality": "BAD", "explanation" : "The variable name is too short", "alternative" : "word_count"},{"name" : "s","quality": "BAD", "explanation" : "Very short names are reserved to indexes", "alternative" : "size"}]

Task:
Find the names of all entities in the snippet.
For each found name, answer the following questions:
Is that name good enough? Can it be improved? Provide a short explanation and if possible an alternative. If the quality is BAD, always propose an alternative name.
